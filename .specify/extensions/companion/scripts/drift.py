"""Detect code that drifted from its Companion living spec.

For each configured capability, report the source files that changed SINCE the
capability's living spec (`capabilities/<name>/spec.md`) was last committed, and
classify each:

  - `tracked`   — the file appears in a `specs/*/.spec-context.json` recorded
                  SINCE the capability spec's last commit (a change that went
                  THROUGH the pipeline but was never folded back → a missed
                  recent sync). Scoped to context files changed in
                  `commit..HEAD`; degrades to `unspeced` if git can't scope it.
  - `unspeced`  — the file changed entirely outside the pipeline (the living
                  spec never saw it at all). More concerning than `tracked`.

The `✓ … in sync` claim is earned only by capabilities that were CHECKED — a run
that skipped every capability reports `0 checked, N skipped` instead, a partly
skipped run states both counts, and callers read `checked` off the result to tell
"clean" from "did not run". A clone without the history to reach a capability's
baseline is skipped rather than compared against the graft boundary.

With `--working` (opt-in), each capability's changed set additionally covers the
working tree: the diff runs baseline→worktree (uncommitted edits and deletions
included) and untracked files are added. The default mode is unchanged, and the
never-halts / counts contract holds in both modes. `/speckit.companion.living-sync`
consumes this mode's `--json` output as its sync plan.

Deterministic: pure git + the LS·1 resolver (membership) + an exempt-glob filter.
It NEVER halts — always exits 0, including when everything was skipped (a skip
without a committed baseline is correct, not a failure). A surrounding workflow /
CI may treat findings as a gate; the command itself does not. With living specs
disabled (or no config), it reports nothing and exits 0 (the LS·1 inert/opt-in
contract).

All git operations are anchored to `--root` (via `git -C <root>`), never cwd, so
pointing it at a sandbox or sibling repo records THAT repo's history.
